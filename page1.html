        <p>“Paths are the channels along which the observer customarily, occasionally, or potentially moves.</p>
        <p>They may be streets, walkways, transit lines, canals, railroads.</p>
        <p>People observe the city while moving through it, and along these paths the other environmental elements are arranged and related.”</p>
